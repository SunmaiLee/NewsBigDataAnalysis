## Sentiment Analysis for a given Keyword

This is a code for the sentiment analysis.

You can run the code with either `main.py` or `linebyline.py` in the spyder folder.

`linebyline.py` was designed for the user who is familiar with Jupyter notebook.

But both of them have the same purpose which is to guess whether the given sentence has the positve or negative meaning.

The outcome returns a number between 0-1, below 0.5 is negative and the opposite is positive.

The value is normalized as it converted to the probability that is easy to perceive.
